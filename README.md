In June 2011, I stopped working on [La Distribution](#ladistribution) and started consulting again. At the same time, I met the nice founders of EyeEm who were in need for help on their backend.

 * <span class="tldr">Solo Founder of a distributed web application platform</span>

**Key Features**:

 * Repositories & Packages: complete package management system for PHP applications, inspired by Linux distributions.
 * Authentication & <abbr title="Single Sign On">SSO</abbr>: Single Sign On system across all installed applications. Distributed authentication with OpenId Connect.

### <a name="netvibes"></a> **[Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/)**<br />
Chief Architect (January 2006 - November 2008)

 * <span class="tldr">Early Engineer in a successful startup</span>

**The Story**:
I met Tariq Krim, Founder of Netvibes, at a conference in Paris a few months after he launched the product. We chatted about the API strategy and figured I could help. I started as a contractor, became more and more involved and finally joined full time. There I launched a successful developer platform and ended as Chief Architect, responsible for the platform vision and technical strategy.

**Achievement**:
helped scale the company from 1 person, ~100K users and ~0$ to 40 people, 10M+ users and 15M$+ in funding. The UWA platform was a key asset when selling Netvibes to Dassault Systèmes.

**Sample Projects**:

 * [UWA](https://uwa.netvibes.com/): invented and launched a simple widget API, cross-platform, and based on web standards. See [techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2007/02/21/netvibes-promises-cross-platform-widget-compatibility/) post.

### <a name="upian"></a> **[Upian](http://www.upian.com/)**<br />
Technical Director (October 2001 - October 2006)

 * <span class="tldr">First Developer in an award winning web studio</span>

**The Story**:
In September 2001, right after the dotcom crash, looking for a first job as a developer was tough. I finally met the founder of Upian, Alexandre Brachet, and was hired to code [Presidentielles.net](http://2002.presidentielles.net/), an improbable website covering the french 2002 presidential election. Things went really well and I then helped the company start and grow its web agency activity, providing my technical guidance and developer magics.

**Achievements**:

 * Grew the web team from 1 to 4 people.
 * Early adoption of web standards and CSS based design.
 * A lot of fantastic projects which are unfortunately all now forgotten.
